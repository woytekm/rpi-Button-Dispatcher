This module provides quick and easy access to Raspberry Pi GPIO buttons


 * You can define three types of GPIO buttons:

   - Single mode button - do defined action every time button is pressed

   - Dual mode button   - do on/off actions in 0-1-0-1 pattern

   - Alt button         - modify action of other buttons
                          (alt+other button = "alt" action of other button)

 * You can define two types of actions. If you want to define a button named "Green",
   following actions can be attached to it:

  - Internal action - execute python routine [button_name][button_mode]Action()
                      ie: GreenOnAction(), GreenOffAction(), GreenAltAction()

  - External action - execute external script [button_name]_[button_mode]_action
                      ie: /etc/Buttons/actions/Green_on_action

 * ButtonDispatcher can be initialized in two ways:

  - From config file

  - By initializing ButtonDispatcher object "manually" in python code


General usage examples are in dispatcher-example1.py, dispatcher-example2.py

Two programs are attached as a practical usage examples:

 - TriButtonRadio - internet radio receiver using three GPIO buttons to control mpg123

 - ButtonDaemon - daemon which executes different shell scripts when GPIO buttons are pressed
